Yep, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. Let me tell you my story.

It all started when I was a kid, I was alone in my town, my parents were pretty far away and I decided to cross the road. SUDDENTLY, a truck rushed in. I couldn't do anything to stop it.

That was my story, now go away.
